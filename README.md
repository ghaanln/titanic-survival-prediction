# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.

It is a classic beginner-friendly binary classification problem that covers the full pipeline: data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries:

- Python, pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- seaborn & matplotlib for visualization

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Results

Best Model: RandomForestClassifier

Accuracy: ~80% on validation set

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

The dataset is provided by [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), one of the most well-known beginner challenges in data science.

## ðŸ™Œ About Me

This is a personal practice project for learning and showcasing machine learning skills.
